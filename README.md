#This is a logger template for embedded systems

This Logger has been coding with CPP. I will complete the different parts of this logger in the future.
This Logger has been designing based on OOP. The high priority in the design is to develop the logger easily based on needs with the
lowest modification.

* The Input calss is your input part and it can be the data you received by the peripherals like uart, spi, ... .
you must customized it based on your system in a way don't change its interface. Edit its methodes' bodies based on your needs.

* The Dispaly can be your LCD or other types of interfaces. So modify it :)

* The data base can be a SD card or Flash or somewhere in HDD. I will code it to cover all aspects.

Moreover I will complete this README file to better understanding.
